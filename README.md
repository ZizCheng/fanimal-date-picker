# fanimal-date-picker

Install script.js and include a <script src="./script.js"></script> tag to use.

Fanimal date picker will create display a single page calendar allowing the user to select a first and second date and highlight all dates in between. Forward/backwards buttons will move one month in either direction. Current output format is an alert message.

Behavior:

2. Clicking a second date before the first date changes the first date to that date.
3. Clicking the same day twice selects it as the start and end date.
